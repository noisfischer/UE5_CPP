This repository contains scripts used in my Unreal Engine 5 game Breakaway - System Malfunction:
- Component scripts used to move, rotate, and scale any actor they are parented to. Has modifiable properties like movement duration, end point, start time, and behavior type.
- An explosive component script that will turn actors into 'exploding barrels' that will deal radial damage. Has modifiable properties like damage, particle effects, and explosion radius.
- A projectile base classed with modifiable speed and damage properties.
- Other miscellaneous tools I practiced with but were not implemented in my game.
